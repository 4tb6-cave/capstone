	\textbf{Attendees:} Abdul, Tabish, Berk, Andrew (all online) \\
	\textbf{Notetaker:} Nicholas	
		\subsection*{Project Goals and Development Plan}
			\subsubsection*{Plan:} 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Work asynchronously throughout the week on goals, add requirements and constraints as they relate to goals.	 
					\item Work on this whenever have time over the next week 
					\item Set main goal small, add stretch goals for other feasible 
					\item Dev Plan rough outline 
					\item Review existing materials from research project and last year’s capstone, going over source code, power pcb, see what is useful for us 
					\item Make contact with old capstone group to understand that power pcb ~end of Sept 
					\item After, test sensors to see how well they work, and roll into proof of concept deliverable ~Oct 
					\item For PoC itself, mainly need to demonstrate software can work with data from the sensors, fusing the two. Electrical and mechanical are minor considerations, test sensor→sfwr model 
					\item critical point of POC is ensuring sensors work for our goal 
					\item Mech, elec, sfwr designed/implemented in parallel, feedback between them, iterations 
					\item Main shortcomings to improve this year for rev0: ToF camera/sensor was not really working last year 
					\item Reusing Pi5, could improve electrical system for rev0. Could also want something more efficient for sensor collection, data processed elsewhere. Do PoC and then re-evaluate 
				\end{itemize}
			\subsubsection*{Development:}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Andrew plugged in the TOF camera and Windows sees it as a serial device
					\item Sensor documentation:\\
